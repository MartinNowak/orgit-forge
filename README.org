* Org links to Forge issue buffers

This package defines the Org link type ~orgit-topic~, which can be
used to link to Forge topic buffers.  This is similar to the ~orgit~
package, which links to various Magit buffers.

Links have the form ~orgit-topic:HASH~.

Note that I do not intend to support any other Forge buffer types.
